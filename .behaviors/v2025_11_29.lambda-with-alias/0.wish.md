wish = can deploy lambdas via declastruct

specifically
1. deploy lambdas given a path to the zip file & list of privs that they'll need
2. attach an alias/qualifier to lambdas that get deployed
  1. alias+=`expect=LIVE|IDLE` to distinguish what should serve live traffic vs what should be idle, by default
  2. alias+=`commit=$commitHash` for all deployments, to distinguish which commit that version is for + target by commit
  3. alias+=`pr=XYZ` for all pr deployments, to easily target lambdas associated with a given pr
