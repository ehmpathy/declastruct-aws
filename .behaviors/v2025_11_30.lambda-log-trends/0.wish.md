given we have a report of costs


| Log Group Name                                                  | Data Ingested | Log Events | Ingestion Cost | % of Total |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| /aws/lambda/svc-chat-prod-getDisplayableMessages                | 3.110 GB      | 6,523,133  | $11.4235       | 39.9%      |
| /aws/lambda/svc-quotes-prod-executeTaskGuideClientToHireProExcl | 1.095 GB      | 2,297,174  | $4.0229        | 14.1%      |
| /aws/lambda/svc-images-prod-getDecoratedImageByUuid             | 0.445 GB      | 933,308    | $1.6344        | 5.7%       |
| /aws/lambda/svc-gateway-prod-graphql                            | 0.334 GB      | 700,184    | $1.2262        | 4.3%       |


we'd like to be able to declare an instruction to get a histogram of
- the log messages emitted by a given set of lambdas
  - what are the common .message attributes?
  - how often do they occur?
  - how large are the messages?

that would help us figure out exactly where the large cost size comes from


---


ideally we could also get the report of ingestion cost declaratively too


---

the key adavantage of doing this declaratively is intelligent cacheability

&&

subsequent composability

---

we can probably declare the resources as
- unique key + readonly key combinations, that will surface the info we care to see

e.g., like our earlier DeclaredGadsPerformanceReports
