had resources which were able to report lambda cost opportunities

i.e.,
- get resources that declare a report on the cost of a lambda over a period of time (w/ the factors that contributed to it; e.g., memory.[paid,used.[max,avg,min,stdev]], duration.[max,avg,min,stdev])
- get resources which declare opportunities to save on cost
  - decrease memory
  - change instance type
  - etc
