# blocker.1

where is the DeclaredAwsSsoInstance resource?

lets still declare it, so that getSsoInstance can return that declared type

create a dao for it and everything

getOne
set

set should simply failfast if someone attempts to create it, and say "must be done manually"

websearch the aws sdk to see the attributes of it

distill the domain object

pay particular attention to the keys of
- unique
- primary
- readonly
- metadata


we want to be able to declare the DeclaredAwsSsoInstance and Ref it to instantiate the other resources, rather than need to use imperatives like getSsoInstance
