# blocker.1

lets rescope the Sso resources under `IamSso`, to make their surdomain clear

DeclaredAwsSsoAccountAssignment -> DeclaredAwsIamSsoAccountAssignment
DeclaredAwsSsoInstance -> DeclaredAwsIamSsoInstance
etc...

these resources are nested within the Iam domain of aws and should be clearly designated as such, just like IamOidc is
