# blocker.1

instead of getUniqueIdentifier, use refByUnique

---

# blocker.2


  public static primary = ['instanceArn'] as const;

src/domain.objects/DeclaredAwsSsoAccountAssignment.ts

if it doesn't have any primary ids, dont include primary ids

also, is this a domain literal? how do we know if its applied or not? is there really no readonly or metadata attributes? double check the aws sdk; e.g., createdAt?

# blocker.3


  /**
   * .what = the identity store this user belongs to
   */
  identityStoreId: string;


how is identity store provisioned?

do we need a DeclaredAws resource to RefByUnique && to provision it?
