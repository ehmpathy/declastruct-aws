wish = given the work we've released to support aws organization account control

we should now be able to
1. control an admin role, under which an admin can signin via `aws sso` (e.g., admin agent)
   1. i.e., find-or-create all the resources required to give someone access under the default aws admin role
2. use that admin role to
   1. set a DeclaredAwsOrganization
   2. set a DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount under that organization
   3. set a narrowed 'ehmpathy-demo-role' under that account
   4. set the resources required to enable someone to signin via `aws sso` under that demo role (e.g., demo agent)
   5. set the resources required to enable github-actions to auth via `oidc` under that demo role
