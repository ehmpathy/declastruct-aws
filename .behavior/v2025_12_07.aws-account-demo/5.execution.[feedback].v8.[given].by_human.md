# blocker.1

make the codepaths in src/domain.operations/ssoUser/getOneSsoUser.ts simpler; more linear and narrative# blocker.1

# blocker.2


export const setSsoPermissionSetTags = async (input: {
  sso: SSOAdminClient;
  instanceArn: string;
  permissionSetArn: string;
  before: Record<string, string>;
  desired: Record<string, string>;
}): Promise<void> => {


make the inputs more self descriptive and consistent with the ProcedureArgs best practice

e.g.,

export const setSsoPermissionSetTags = async (input: {
  for: {
    instanceArn, permissionSetArn
  },
  update: {
    from: Record<string, string>,
    into: Record<string, string>;
  }
}, context: {
  sso: SSOAdminClient;
}): Promise<void> => {


make that same change across all setSsoPermissionSet* operations



# blocker.3

never destructure inputs


  const { sso, instanceArn, permissionSetArn, before, desired } = input;

this makes the code harder to read

input.instanceArn is MUCH more intuitive to understand than just instanceArn
- tells you exactly where it came from

its also less likely to conflict with internal variables
- e.g., you may have other instanceArns you want to operate within the procedure that you dont want to risk having to shaddow a global instanceArn against

not to mention makes it easier to find all of the inputs via prefix! autocomplete ftw

this is a hard blocker; it is a FORBIDDEN bad practice to destructure inputs; always use the `input.` prefix to increase legibility and readability and decrease scope pollution


# blocker.4

 ('arn' in by.unique.permissionSet
        ? by.unique.permissionSet.arn
        : undefined) ??

        =>

        by.unique.permissionSet?.arn ??

never use a ternary when optional chains work more concicely

this issue is all over the place. fix it everywhere
