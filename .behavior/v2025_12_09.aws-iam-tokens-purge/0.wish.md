wish =

could

getAllIamTokens({ by: { account: RefByPrimary<typeof DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount> }})

and mark them all for deletion

i.e., add `deletedAt: 'ASAP'`

or

i.e., wrap with `del(token)` => which will apply the `.[SymbolGlobal('declastruct.delete')]='ASAP'` attribute to the object

the, declastruct would invoke the dao.delete operation for each resource that has that declaration


---

 in this repo, declare the
 1. domain entity for the IamTokens i'm referring to
 2. domain operations (getOne, getAll, set, del)
 3. dao

that would support this behavior
