# blocker.1

instead of an acceptance test file

lets declare this new provision

create a provision/aws/resources.ts file (like provision/github/resources.ts file)

which i can execute with admin aws credentials to do steps 2-3

so steps:
2. create an organization
3. within the organization, create a new demo account
