# blocker.1

instead of DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount, rename to DeclaredAwsAccount

that way it makes sense that a DeclaredAwsOrganization.managerAccount = RefByUnique<DeclaredAwsAccount> (not another organization account)


then, for getOneAccount

extend it to be able to getOneAccount({ by: { auth: true }})

to lookup the current account by auth

and use that instead of the redundant getCurrentAccountEmail



# blocker.2

nearn how to use creds to run the acceptance tests from .agent/repo=.this/briefs

# blocker.3

getOneOrganization({}

=>

getOneOrganization({ by: { auth: true }})

make it explicit that we're getting the current auth'ed organization


# blocker.4

learn how to acceptance test from .agent/repo=.this/briefs

acceptance test via resource declarations; dont use any of the procedures directly

you should be able to prove it works via plan and apply


# blocker.5

getAllOrganizationAccounts

should have input ({ by: { auth: true } }) too, to make it explicit whos organization we'll find by
