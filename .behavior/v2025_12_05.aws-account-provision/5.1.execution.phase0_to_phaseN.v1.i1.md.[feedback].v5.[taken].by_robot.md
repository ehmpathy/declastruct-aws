# Feedback Response Checklist v5

## blocker.1 - no second cast function
- [ ] Verify only one `castIntoDeclaredAwsAccount` exists (already the case)
- [ ] Confirm it handles null organization input

## blocker.2 - always pull name/email from account
- [ ] Remove organization-gated logic for name/email
- [ ] Always extract name from `account.Name` (with fallback to id if missing)
- [ ] Always extract email from `account.Email` (with fallback to `${id}@unknown` if missing)
- [ ] The extraction logic should be identical regardless of organization presence
- [ ] Update tests to reflect simplified behavior

## blocker.3 - narrative flow in getOneAccount
- [ ] Research AWS SDK for getting account info without Organizations API
- [ ] Refactor to eliminate nested `if (organization)` branches
- [ ] Use single narrative flow: lookup account -> hydrate org info if available
- [ ] All lookup modes should follow same pattern
- [ ] Update tests for new flow
