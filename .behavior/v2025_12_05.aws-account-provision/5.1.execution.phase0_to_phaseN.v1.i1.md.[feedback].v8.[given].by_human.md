# blocker.1

where are the unit tests for organization account?


# blocker.2

  // fail-fast: require org manager auth
    const organization = await getOneOrganization(
      { by: { auth: true } },
      context,
    );
    if (!organization)
      BadRequestError.throw(
        'org manager auth required to list organization accounts',
        { input },
      );

    // declare the client
    const client = new OrganizationsClient({
      region: context.aws.credentials.region,
    });


put that into one `await getAwsOrganizationClient(context)` operation under access/sdk's


# blocker.3

update the acceptance test to test adding an organization;

i'll tell you when i update the credentials to make the creds found in `.agent/repo=.this` a manager account

but prepare for that test to  be written how the `.agent/repo=.this/breifs` declare
