it were easy to provision a new aws account with declastruct-aws

e.g., for the usecase of creation of a demo account to use for ehmpathy public tests

e.g., ehmpathy-cicd-public account

would we need billing setup?

repos to update w/ this account, btw
- simple-on-disk-cache
- simple-dynamodb-cache
- declastruct-aws
