# blocker.1

no second function to castIntoDeclaredAwsAccount; the current one already supports a null organization input

# blocker.2

what is this ?


  const name = input.organization
    ? assure(input.account.Name, isPresent)
    : input.account.Name ?? id;
  const email = input.organization
    ? assure(input.account.Email, isPresent)
    : input.account.Email ?? `${id}@unknown`;


  always pull those values off of the account

  why ever would we gate those based on the presense of organization? that is insane


# blocker.3

in the getOneAccount operation


      // if in an organization, use DescribeAccount for any account
      if (organization) {


eliminate these nested if branches

it should be a narrative flow


always try and lookup the account; if we find it, always try and ALSO hydrate organization info for it (use an explicit lookup via the aws sdk; websearch how to do this)

that single narrative flow should cover both cases

if it does not, find a single narrative flow that does (e.g., start with org based search and fallback to default)

but preferably we can always find by normal account and then hydrate org


# blocker.4

has readonly checks both explicit readonly and metadata readnoly

why are your tests not supplying all of the readonly? (metadta too)
