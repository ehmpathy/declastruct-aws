# blocker.1
cant we get accounts without organizations? i.e., some accounts (like the root account) wont be in an
  organization


# blocker.2


  /**
   * .what = the organization this account belongs to
   * .note = is @readonly — derived from AWS, parsed from ARN
   */
  organization?: RefByUnique<typeof DeclaredAwsOrganization>;


  organization can be null for root accounts;


  make all of the organization dependent attributes nullable, since on read we'll find those to benull

# blocker.3

dont use new Dobj({ ...}); always use Dobj.as({ ... })

# blocker.4


 *   - { by: { primary } } and { by: { unique } } require organization membership
*

by primary and by unique should always support without orgnization, on getAccount

there's no reason why we cant lookup the  account details for our own account by any of those attributes
