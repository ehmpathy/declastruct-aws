# blocker.1

ok, lets rollback to the original blueprint in .behavior/v2025_12_05.aws-account-provision/3.3.blueprint.v1.i1.md and .behavior/v2025_12_05.aws-account-provision/3.2.distill.domain._.v1.i1.md

DeclaredAwsAccount => DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount

except this time, on the gets and sets of DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount, fail fast anytime someone tries to get an account but is not authed as an organization manager

(since they wont be able to see any of the attributes we care about to manage accounts)

however, lets update

DeclaredAwsOrganization.managementAccount = RefByPrimary<typeof DeclaredAwsOrganizationAccount>
- that way, when someone wants to declare an Organization under the "current" account, they can just say
- const identity = await getOneIdentity({ by: { auth }})
- =>
- DeclaredAwsOrganization.as({
  - managementAccount: { id: identity.account.id }
- })
